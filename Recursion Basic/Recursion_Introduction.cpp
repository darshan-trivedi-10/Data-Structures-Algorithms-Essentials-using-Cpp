/*
Recursion : Recursion in computer science is a technique where the solution to a problem depends on solution to smaller instances of the problem.

Ex : Factorial
     f(n) = n!
          = n * (n-1)!
          = n * f(n-1)!

Recursion = Principal of Mathematical Induction

1. Figure of the smallest case
2. Always Assume the subproblem can be solved
3. Solve the current problem assuming subproblem solution
   exists.
